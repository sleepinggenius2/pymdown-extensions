If you prefer to use something other than MathJax, Arithmatex can output a more generic format.\n\n\nArithmatex searches for the patterns \n$\n...\n$\n and \n\\(\n...\n\\)\n for inline math, and \n$$\n...\n$$\n, \n\\[\n...\n\\]\n, and \n\\begin\n{}\n...\n\\end\n{}\n for block math. By default, all formats are enabled, but each format can individually be disabled if desired.\n\n\nInput Format\n\ue157\n\n\nFor the \n$\n...\n$\n inline variant, it is expected that the opening token (\n$\n) is to be followed by a non-whitespace character, and the closing to be preceded by a non-white-space character.  This is to help avoid false positives when using the dollar sign in traditional ways such as: I have $2.00 and Bob has $10.00.  The previous statement requires no escaping of the \n$\n character.  But when needed, the \n$\n character can be escaped using \n\\$\n.\n\n\n\n\nInline Examples\n\n\n$\np\n(\nx|y\n)\n \n=\n \n\\frac\n{p\n(\ny|x\n)\np\n(\nx\n)\n}{p\n(\ny\n)\n}\n$\n, \n\\(\np\n(\nx|y\n)\n \n=\n \n\\frac\n{p\n(\ny|x\n)\np\n(\nx\n)\n}{p\n(\ny\n)\n}\n\\)\n.\n\n\n\n\np(x|y) = \\frac{p(y|x)p(x)}{p(y)}\np(x|y) = \\frac{p(y|x)p(x)}{p(y)}\n, \np(x|y) = \\frac{p(y|x)p(x)}{p(y)}\np(x|y) = \\frac{p(y|x)p(x)}{p(y)}\n.\n\n\n\n\nFor block forms, the block must start with the appropriate opening for the block type: \n$$\n, \n\\[\n, and \n\\begin\n{}\n for the respective search pattern. The block must also end with the proper respective end: \n$$\n, \n\\]\n, and \n\\end\n{}\n. A block also must contain no empty lines and should be both preceded and followed by an empty line.\n\n\n\n\nBlock Examples\n\n\n$$\n\n\nE\n(\n\\mathbf\n{v}, \n\\mathbf\n{h}\n)\n \n=\n \n-\n\\sum\n_{i,j}w_{ij}v_i h_j \n-\n \n\\sum\n_i b_i v_i \n-\n \n\\sum\n_j c_j h_j\n\n\n$$\n\n\n\n\\[\n3\n < \n4\n\\]\n\n\n\n\\begin\n{\nalign\n}\n\n    p(v\n_\ni=1|\n\\mathbf\n{\nh\n}\n) \n&\n = \n\\sigma\\left\n(\n\\sum\n_\nj w\n_{\nij\n}\nh\n_\nj + b\n_\ni\n\\right\n) \n\\\\\n\n    p(h\n_\nj=1|\n\\mathbf\n{\nv\n}\n) \n&\n = \n\\sigma\\left\n(\n\\sum\n_\ni w\n_{\nij\n}\nv\n_\ni + c\n_\nj\n\\right\n)\n\n\\end\n{\nalign\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nE(\\mathbf{v}, \\mathbf{h}) = -\\sum_{i,j}w_{ij}v_i h_j - \\sum_i b_i v_i - \\sum_j c_j h_j\n\n\n\n\nE(\\mathbf{v}, \\mathbf{h}) = -\\sum_{i,j}w_{ij}v_i h_j - \\sum_i b_i v_i - \\sum_j c_j h_j\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3 < 4\n\n\n3 < 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{align}\n    p(v_i=1|\\mathbf{h}) & = \\sigma\\left(\\sum_j w_{ij}h_j + b_i\\right) \\\\\n    p(h_j=1|\\mathbf{v}) & = \\sigma\\left(\\sum_i w_{ij}v_i + c_j\\right)\n\\end{align}\n\n\n\\begin{align}\n    p(v_i=1|\\mathbf{h}) & = \\sigma\\left(\\sum_j w_{ij}h_j + b_i\\right) \\\\\n    p(h_j=1|\\mathbf{v}) & = \\sigma\\left(\\sum_i w_{ij}v_i + c_j\\right)\n\\end{align}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMathJax Output Format\n\ue157\n\n\nThe math equations will be wrapped in a special MathJax script tag and embedded into the HTML. MathJax can already find these scripts, so there is no need to include and configure the \ntex2jax.js\n extension when setting up MathJax. The tag will be \n<\nscript\n \ntype\n=\n\"math/tex\"\n></\nscript\n>\n for inline and \n<\nscript\n \ntype\n=\n\"math/tex; mode=display\"\n></\nscript\n>\n for block.\n\n\nBy default, Arithmatex will also generate a preview span with the class \nMathJax_Preview\n that MathJax will hide when the math content is actually loaded. If you do not want to see the preview, simply set \npreview\n to \nFalse\n.\n\n\nGeneric Output Format\n\ue157\n\n\nIf \ngeneric\n is enabled, the extension will escape necessary symbols and normalize all output to be wrapped in the more reliable \n\\(\n...\n\\)\n for inline math and \n\\[\n...\n\\]\n for block math. The wrapping convention can be changed via \ntex_inline_wrap\n and \ntex_block_wrap\n in the \noptions\n. Then the wrapped content will be inserted into a \nspan\n or \ndiv\n for inline and display math respectively.\n\n\nWith the default settings, if in your Markdown you used \n$\n...\n$\n, it would be converted to \n<\nspan\n \nclass\n=\n\"arithmatex\"\n>\n\\(...\\)\n</\nspan\n>\n in the HTML. Blocks would be normalized from \n$$\n...\n$$\n to \n<\ndiv\n \nclass\n=\n\"arithmatex\"\n>\n\\[...\\]\n</\ndiv\n>\n.  In the case of \n\\begin\n{}\n...\n\\end\n{}\n, begins and ends will not be replaced, only wrapped: \n<\ndiv\n \nclass\n=\n\"arithmatex\"\n>\n\\[\\begin{}...\\end{}\\]\n</\ndiv\n>\n.  Since Arithmatex provides additional logic to curb issues with \n$\n, we allow it in the Markdown. If a different wrapper is desired, see \nOptions\n below to learn how to change the wrapper.\n\n\nLoading MathJax\n\ue157\n\n\nArithmatex requires you to provide the MathJax library and provide and configure it to your liking.  The recommended way of including MathJax is to use the CDN.

If you prefer to use something other than MathJax, Arithmatex can output a more generic format.  Arithmatex searches for the patterns  $ ... $  and  \\( ... \\)  for inline math, and  $$ ... $$ ,  \\[ ... \\] , and  \\begin {} ... \\end {}  for block math. By default, all formats are enabled, but each format can individually be disabled if desired.",

            "text": "For the  $ ... $  inline variant, it is expected that the opening token ( $ ) is to be followed by a non-whitespace character, and the closing to be preceded by a non-white-space character.  This is to help avoid false positives when using the dollar sign in traditional ways such as: I have $2.00 and Bob has $10.00.  The previous statement requires no escaping of the  $  character.  But when needed, the  $  character can be escaped using  \\$ .   Inline Examples  $ p ( x|y )   =   \\frac {p ( y|x ) p ( x ) }{p ( y ) } $ ,  \\( p ( x|y )   =   \\frac {p ( y|x ) p ( x ) }{p ( y ) } \\) .  p(x|y) = \\frac{p(y|x)p(x)}{p(y)} p(x|y) = \\frac{p(y|x)p(x)}{p(y)} ,  p(x|y) = \\frac{p(y|x)p(x)}{p(y)} p(x|y) = \\frac{p(y|x)p(x)}{p(y)} .   For block forms, the block must start with the appropriate opening for the block type:  $$ ,  \\[ , and  \\begin {}  for the respective search pattern. The block must also end with the proper respective end:  $$ ,  \\] , and  \\end {} . A block also must contain no empty lines and should be both preceded and followed by an empty line.   Block Examples  $$  E ( \\mathbf {v},  \\mathbf {h} )   =   - \\sum _{i,j}w_{ij}v_i h_j  -   \\sum _i b_i v_i  -   \\sum _j c_j h_j  $$  \\[ 3  <  4 \\]  \\begin { align } \n    p(v _ i=1| \\mathbf { h } )  &  =  \\sigma\\left ( \\sum _ j w _{ ij } h _ j + b _ i \\right )  \\\\ \n    p(h _ j=1| \\mathbf { v } )  &  =  \\sigma\\left ( \\sum _ i w _{ ij } v _ i + c _ j \\right ) \\end { align }    \nE(\\mathbf{v}, \\mathbf{h}) = -\\sum_{i,j}w_{ij}v_i h_j - \\sum_i b_i v_i - \\sum_j c_j h_j  \nE(\\mathbf{v}, \\mathbf{h}) = -\\sum_{i,j}w_{ij}v_i h_j - \\sum_i b_i v_i - \\sum_j c_j h_j    3 < 4  3 < 4    \\begin{align}\n    p(v_i=1|\\mathbf{h}) & = \\sigma\\left(\\sum_j w_{ij}h_j + b_i\\right) \\\\\n    p(h_j=1|\\mathbf{v}) & = \\sigma\\left(\\sum_i w_{ij}v_i + c_j\\right)\n\\end{align}  \\begin{align}\n    p(v_i=1|\\mathbf{h}) & = \\sigma\\left(\\sum_j w_{ij}h_j + b_i\\right) \\\\\n    p(h_j=1|\\mathbf{v}) & = \\sigma\\left(\\sum_i w_{ij}v_i + c_j\\right)\n\\end{align}",

Smart Break Example  __This will all be bold __because of the placement of the center underscores.__\n\n__This will all be bold __ because of the placement of the center underscores.__\n\n__This will NOT all be bold__ because of the placement of the center underscores.__\n\n__This will all be bold_ because of the token is less than that of the surrounding.__  This will all be bold __because of the placement of the center underscores.  This will all be bold __ because of the placement of the center asterisks.  This will NOT all be bold  because of the placement of the center underscores.__  This will all be bold_ because the token count is less than that of the surrounding.   BetterEm will allow non-smart emphasis to contain \"floating\" like tokens.   Floating Token Example  `*All will * be italic*\n\n`*All will *be italic*\n\n`*All will not* be italic*\n\n`*All will not ** be italic*\n\n`**All will * be bold**\n\n`**All will *be bold**\n\n`**All will not*** be bold**\n\n`**All will not *** be bold**  All will * be italic  All will *be italic  All will not  be italic*  All will not *  be italic*  All will * be bold  All will *be bold  All will not * be bold**  All will not * be bold**",

If you need to reject critic marks or accept them, the Critic extension will work quite well.

The existence of the critic edits can alter the actual source.  Its a fantastic idea, but it should be understood that when using CriticMarkup beyond inline or block paragraphs, there is a possibility that invalid HTML will be created for the preview (especially in relation to lists or if breaking up Markdown syntax).  I think Fletcher said it best here: \nhttp://fletcher.github.io/MultiMarkdown-4/criticmarkup\n.\n\n\nThe Critic extension does its best by employing a preprocessor to inject the critic tags before all other parsing and a post-processor to clean up some of the weird side effects of the injection (only selected odd cases as others are more difficult to fix).  It injects some classes into the edit region's HTML output which allows for CSS styling.  There is probably a lot more post-processing that could be done to fix more issues, but whether this extension will be going further down that road has not yet been decided.\n\n\nCSS\n\ue157\n\n\nCritic renders the CriticMarkup with the following classes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClasses\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncritic\n\n\nThis is applied to all critic edits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbreak\n\n\nThis is applied to critic inserts or deletes that encompass \nonly\n 2+ newlines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nblock\n\n\nApplied to critic HTML tags that are detected as surrounding a block region.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncomment\n\n\nA CriticMarkup comment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBasic CSS Setup\n/* Critic Markup */\n\n\n.\nmarkdown-body\n \n.\ncritic\n \n{\n\n  \nfont-family\n:\n \ninherit\n;\n\n  \n-webkit-\nborder-radius\n:\n \n3\npx\n;\n\n  \n-moz-\nborder-radius\n:\n \n3\npx\n;\n\n  \nborder-radius\n:\n \n3\npx\n;\n\n  \nborder-style\n:\n \nsolid\n;\n\n  \nborder-width\n:\n \n1\npx\n;\n\n  \npadding-top\n:\n \n0.1\nem\n;\n\n  \npadding-bottom\n:\n \n0.1\nem\n;\n\n  \ntext-decoration\n:\n \nnone\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n.\nmarkdown-body\n \n.\ncritic\n:\nbefore\n,\n\n\n.\nmarkdown-body\n \n.\ncritic\n:\nafter\n \n{\n\n  \ncontent\n:\n \n'\\00a0'\n;\n\n  \npadding-top\n:\n \n0.1\nem\n;\n\n  \npadding-bottom\n:\n \n0.1\nem\n;\n\n  \nfont-size\n:\n \ninitial\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n.\nmarkdown-body\n \n.\nblock\n:\nbefore\n,\n\n\n.\nmarkdown-body\n \n.\nblock\n:\nafter\n \n{\n\n  \ncontent\n:\n \n''\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n.\nmarkdown-body\n \nmark\n.\ncritic\n \n{\n\n  \nborder-color\n:\n \n#ff8600\n;\n\n  \nbackground\n:\n \n#ffddaa\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n.\nmarkdown-body\n \nins\n.\ncritic\n \n{\n\n  \nborder-color\n:\n \n#00bb00\n;\n\n  \nbackground\n:\n \n#ddffdd\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n.\nmarkdown-body\n \ndel\n.\ncritic\n \n{\n\n  \nborder-color\n:\n \n#dd0000\n;\n\n  \nbackground\n:\n \n#ffdddd\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n.\nmarkdown-body\n \nins\n.\nbreak\n,\n\n\n.\nmarkdown-body\n \ndel\n.\nbreak\n \n{\n\n  \nfont-size\n:\n \n0\n;\n\n  \nborder\n:\n \nnone\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n.\nmarkdown-body\n \nins\n.\nbreak\n:\nbefore\n,\n\n\n.\nmarkdown-body\n \ndel\n.\nbreak\n:\nbefore\n \n{\n\n  \ncontent\n:\n \n'\\00a0\\b6\\00a0'\n;\n\n  \n-webkit-\nborder-radius\n:\n \n3\npx\n;\n\n  \n-moz-\nborder-radius\n:\n \n3\npx\n;\n\n  \nborder-radius\n:\n \n3\npx\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n.\nmarkdown-body\n \nins\n.\nafter\n,\n\n\n.\nmarkdown-body\n \ndel\n.\nafter\n \n{\n\n  \ncontent\n:\n \n''\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n.\nmarkdown-body\n \nins\n.\nbreak\n:\nbefore\n \n{\n\n  \ncolor\n:\n \n#00bb00\n;\n\n  \nborder\n:\n \n1\npx\n \nsolid\n \n#00bb00\n;\n\n  \nbackground\n:\n \n#ddffdd\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n.\nmarkdown-body\n \ndel\n.\nbreak\n:\nbefore\n \n{\n\n  \ncolor\n:\n \n#bb0000\n;\n\n  \nborder\n:\n \n1\npx\n \nsolid\n \n#bb0000\n;\n\n  \nbackground\n:\n \n#ffdddd\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n.\nmarkdown-body\n \nspan\n.\ncritic\n \n{\n\n  \nbackground\n:\n \n#ddddff\n;\n\n  \nborder\n:\n \n0\n;\n\n  \nborder-top\n:\n \n1\npx\n \nsolid\n \n#0000bb\n;\n\n  \nborder-bottom\n:\n \n1\npx\n \nsolid\n \n#0000bb\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n.\nmarkdown-body\n \nspan\n.\ncritic\n:\nbefore\n,\n\n\n.\nmarkdown-body\n \nspan\n.\ncritic\n:\nafter\n \n{\n\n  \nfont-size\n:\n \ninherit\n;\n\n  \nbackground\n:\n \n#ddddff\n;\n\n  \nborder\n:\n \n1\npx\n \nsolid\n \n#0000bb\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n.\nmarkdown-body\n \nspan\n.\ncritic\n:\nbefore\n \n{\n\n  \ncontent\n:\n \n'\\00a0\\bb'\n;\n\n  \nborder-right\n:\n \nnone\n;\n\n  \n-webkit-\nborder-top-left-radius\n:\n \n3\npx\n;\n\n  \n-moz-\nborder-top-left-radius\n:\n \n3\npx\n;\n\n  \nborder-top-left-radius\n:\n \n3\npx\n;\n\n  \n-webkit-\nborder-bottom-left-radius\n:\n \n3\npx\n;\n\n  \n-moz-\nborder-bottom-left-radius\n:\n \n3\npx\n;\n\n  \nborder-bottom-left-radius\n:\n \n3\npx\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n.\nmarkdown-body\n \nspan\n.\ncritic\n:\nafter\n \n{\n\n  \ncontent\n:\n \n'\\ab\\00a0'\n;\n\n  \nborder-left\n:\n \nnone\n;\n\n  \n-webkit-\nborder-top-right-radius\n:\n \n3\npx\n;\n\n  \n-moz-\nborder-top-right-radius\n:\n \n3\npx\n;\n\n  \nborder-top-right-radius\n:\n \n3\npx\n;\n\n  \n-webkit-\nborder-bottom-right-radius\n:\n \n3\npx\n;\n\n  \n-moz-\nborder-bottom-right-radius\n:\n \n3\npx\n;\n\n  \nborder-bottom-right-radius\n:\n \n3\npx\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n.\nmarkdown-body\n \n.\nblock\n \n{\n\n  \ndisplay\n:\n \nblock\n;\n\n  \npadding\n:\n \n.02\nem\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\nOptions\n\ue157\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOption\n\n\nType\n\n\nDefault\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmode\n\n\nstring\n\n\nview\n\n\nview\n just parses the markup and displays it in its HTML equivalent rendering.  \naccept\n strips out the critic markup and replaces them with the suggested changes.  \nreject\n rejects all the suggestions and strips the critic markup out replacing it with the original.",

            "text": "Emoji\n\ue157\n\n\nOverview\n\ue157\n\n\nThe Emoji extension adds support for inserting emoji via simple short names enclosed within colons: \n:short_name:\n.  This is accomplished by using a short name index to map easy to remember names to associated Unicode data. The Unicode data is then converted into actual Unicode emoji characters and/or special HTML elements (usually images) that represent the emoji.\n\n\n\n\nEmoji Example\n\n\n:smile: :heart: :thumbsup:\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\nSupported Emoji Providers\n\ue157\n\n\nThere are a number of emoji short name conventions that people may be aware of. These conventions are always tied to a specific emoji set. These conventions differ because there is no official Unicode short name convention. At the present, Emoji chooses to focus on three specific emoji sets:\n\n\n\n\nGemoji\n (\n \n \n): Gemoji is GitHub's open source emoji solution. It contains a lot of common emoji and a couple special, non Unicode emoji (like Gemoji's \n:octocat:\n). If you are a GitHub user, you are probably familiar with some of the short names associated with it. Their associated CDN contains the emoji in 75x75 PNG format.\n\n\nEmojiOne\n (\n \n \n): EmojiOne is a very complete, high quality emoji set with support for gender and skin tone modifiers. Their free emoji set includes PNGs in sizes of 32x32, 64x64, and 128x128 which are all available via a CDN. Their older (version 2.2.7) emoji set, which contains less emoji, offers SVG images as well. Emoji supports EmojiOne's newest short name mapping, but it can be used for their older set, but short names for emoji that have been added since the old set will not map to any images if this is done.\n\n\nTwemoji\n (\n \n \n): Twemoji is Twitter's open source emoji set which also covers a great many emoji with skin tones and gender modifiers. The hosted CDN provides 72x72 PNG emoji or SVG emoji. While Gemoji and EmojiOne have a short name convention, Twemoji does not, and there are currently no 3\nrd\n projects that provide short names anywhere close to all the provided emoji. Since EmojiOne has the largest emoji library of the supported sets, we use EmojiOne's short name list for Twemoji. There will be a reasonable attempt to patch in emoji not found in EmojiOne's index, but if EmojiOne is ever significantly behind, we may wait for EmojiOne to catch up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmoji Image Licensing\n\n\nPyMdown Extensions has no affiliation with EmojiOne, Gemoji, or Twemoji.

The indexes contain the emoji names, short names, values, etc.; everything needed to insert Unicode emoji characters or specially crafted HTML elements.\n\n\nEmoji Output Formats\n\ue157\n\n\nDepending on your needs, you may have different requirements for how emoji get displayed in your documents. You may want to use PNG images, or maybe you really like SVG images. Maybe you just want to convert short names to the actual Unicode code points.  There are a variety of ways you may want to output emoji, and the Emoji extension has you covered.\n\n\nEmoji provides various output formats that take the Unicode data associated with a short name (or the short name itself in the case of a custom emoji) and generates an HTML output. Not all of the provided output formats will work for each emoji index, but there are a few that should work for all three. Check out \nDefault Emoji Generators\n or \nCustom Emoji Generators\n to learn more.\n\n\nDefault Emoji Indexes\n\ue157\n\n\nBy default, Emoji provides three indexes: \nemojione\n, \ngemoji\n, and \ntwemoji\n.  All indexes are generated from the most recent official release tag source (in the case of Twemoji, sort names are acquired from EmojiOne's generated index). They can be used by passing in one of the three functions below via the \nemoji_index\n parameter.  Pass the actual function reference, not a string. If you need to create your own, just check out \nCustom Emoji Indexes\n.\n\n\n\n\npymdownx.emoji.emojione\n\n\n\n\nThis is the default function that is used, and it provides an index using the latest EmojiOne supported emoji (at the time of release).\n\n\nYou can always find out what tag it was built with by doing the following:\n\n\n>>> \nimport\n \npymdownx.emoji1_db\n \nas\n \ne1db\n\n\n>>> \ne1db\n.\nversion\n\n\n'v3.1.2'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmojiOne Update\n\n\nRecent EmojiOne 3.0 release dropped fee SVG support. PNG support can still be obtained via CDNs.\n\n\nWhile EmojiOne only offers 3.0 vector graphics to paying customers now, you can still get SVG support. By default, we still use 2.2.7 SVGs, but you won't get images for emoji added after 2.2.7. If using SVG sprites, you will have to \ndownload\n the sprite SVG.\n\n\n\n\n\n\npymdownx.emoji.gemoji\n\n\n\n\nThis function provides an index of the latest Gemoji supported emoji (at the time of release).\n\n\nYou can always find out what tag it was built with by doing the following:\n\n\n>>> \nimport\n \npymdownx.gemoji_db\n \nas\n \ngmdb\n\n\n>>> \ngmdb\n.\nversion\n\n\n'v3.0.0'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npymdownx.emoji.twemoji\n\n\n\n\nThis function provides an index of the latest Twemoji supported emoji (at the time of release).  The associated short names are currently borrowed from EmojiOne's index. These few emoji are currently Twemoji specific, two of which are likely to always be as they are not part of the official emoji spec:\n\n\n\n\n:skier_tone1:\n\n\n:skier_tone2:\n\n\n:skier_tone3:\n\n\n:skier_tone4:\n\n\n:skier_tone5:\n\n\n:pirage_flag:\n\n\n:shibuya:\n\n\n\n\nYou can always find out what tag it was built with by doing the following:\n\n\n>>> \nimport\n \npymdownx.twemoji_db\n \nas\n \ntwdb\n\n\n>>> \ntwdb\n.\nversion\n\n\n'v2.5.0'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefault Emoji Generators\n\ue157\n\n\nEmoji provides six default emoji generators. PNG output and Unicode code point output are supported for all three indexes. SVG output is only supported for Twemoji and the older 2.2.7 EmojiOne set. PNG sprites and the \"Font Awesome\" like format are only supported by EmojiOne.  SVG sprites is only supported by the 2.2.7 EmojiOne.\n\n\nYou can select a generator to use by passing in one of the functions below via the \nemoji_generator\n parameter.  Pass the actual function reference, not a string. If you need to create your own, just check out \nCustom Emoji Generators\n.\n\n\n\n\npymdownx.emoji.to_png\n\n\n\n\nThis is a general purpose generator which provides EmojiOne, GitHub, and Twemoji CDN path(s) out of the box. Depending on the index you've chosen, you the appropriate CDN will be provided.  If this ever gets out of date, a new CDN can be passed in via \nimage_path\n and/or \nnon_standard_image_path\n. EmojiOne actually has multiple PNGs sizes of 32, 64, and 128, but the default CDN path is the one for size 64: \nhttps://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/64/\n. You can change it for a larger or smaller PNG size by updating the size in the URL and passing the new URL in through \nimage_path\n. The PNG output form is as follows:\n\n\n<\nimg\n \nalt\n=\n\"\ud83d\ude04\"\n \nclass\n=\n\"emojione\"\n \nsrc\n=\n\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/64/1f604.png\"\n \ntitle\n=\n\":smile:\"\n \n/>\n\n\n\n\n\nGenerator Specific Options\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOption\n\n\nType\n\n\nDefault\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nclasses\n\n\nstring\n\n\nName of the index used\n\n\nSpecifies the class(es) to be used in the image element.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage_path\n\n\nstring\n\n\nCDN for the default index used\n\n\nThis can be either a local path or a CDN containing the assets.  By default, an appropriate CDN is provided for EmojiOne, Gemoji, and Twemoji depending on which index is being used.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnon_standard_image_path\n\n\nstring\n\n\nCDN for the default index used\n\n\nThis can be either a local path, or a CDN containing the assets. Currently, only Gemoji's non-standard emoji take advantage of this as the GitHub CDN alters the path slightly for its non-Unicode emoji.  By default, an appropriate CDN is provided for Gemoji.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nattributes\n\n\ndictionary\n\n\n{}\n\n\nA dictionary containing tag attributes as key value string pairs. The dictionary keys are the attribute names and dictionary values are the attribute values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npymdownx.emoji.to_svg\n\n\n\n\nThis generator was written to output SVG images and supports EmojiOne and Twemoji. EmojiOne's SVG support is only for the free 2.2.7 release, so the default CDN still references the 2.2.7 release. EmojiOne short names added after 2.2.7 will not find images.  You can of course reference local SVG images as well by pointing \nimage_path\n to them as well. The SVG image outputs as:\n\n\n<\nimg\n \nalt\n=\n\"\ud83d\ude04\"\n \nclass\n=\n\"emojione\"\n \nsrc\n=\n\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/svg/1f604.svg\"\n \ntitle\n=\n\":smile:\"\n \n/>\n\n\n\n\n\nGenerator Specific Options\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOption\n\n\nType\n\n\nDefault\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nclasses\n\n\nstring\n\n\nName of the index used\n\n\nSpecifies the class(es) to be used in the image element.

It is expected that this will be used in conjunction with the the official EmojiOne CSS.  You can include the CSS from the CDN in your document. The CSS comes in three sizes: 32, 64, 128. Make sure to set the correct size in the options to generate the appropriate classes.\n\n\nExample CDN for the 3.1 version with 64px PNGs: \nhttps://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/sprites/emojione-sprite-64.min.css\n.\n\n\nto_png_sprite\n outputs the emoji as a span in the form below.  The CSS will apply the appropriate mapping in the sprite PNG to the background image of the span.\n\n\n<\nspan\n \nclass\n=\n\"emojione-64-people _1f604\"\n \ntitle\n=\n\":smile:\"\n>\n\ud83d\ude04\n</\nspan\n>\n\n\n\n\n\nGenerator Specific Options\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOption\n\n\nType\n\n\nDefault\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nclasses\n\n\nstring\n\n\nName of the index used\n\n\nClass(es) used for the span where the classes are inserted as \"class\" in the following template: \n'\n%(class)s\n-\n%(size)s\n-\n%(category)s\n _\n%(unicode)s\n'\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsize\n\n\nint\n\n\n64\n\n\nInteger specifying the size for the class above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nattributes\n\n\ndictionary\n\n\n{}\n\n\nA dictionary containing tag attributes as key value string pairs.

The output form was taken directly from an example in the EmojiOne source.  It is expected that the the user will provide a local version of the official SVG sprite and the path to it.  Unfortunately there is no free 3.0 SVG sprite, so you will need to \ndownload\n the old 2.27 one. The output is:\n\n\n<\nsvg\n \nclass\n=\n\"emojione\"\n><\ndescription\n>\n\ud83d\ude04\n</\ndescription\n><\nuse\n \nxlink:href\n=\n\"./../assets/sprites/emojione.sprites.svg#emoji-1f604\"\n></\nuse\n></\nsvg\n>\n\n\n\n\n\nGenerator Specific Options\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOption\n\n\nType\n\n\nDefault\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nclasses\n\n\nstring\n\n\nName of the index used\n\n\nClass(es) to apply to the \nsvg\n element where the classes are inserted as \"class\" in the following template: \n'\n%(class)s\n-\n%(unicode)s\n'\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage_path\n\n\nstring\n\n\n''\n\n\nPath to the SVG sprites.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npymdownx.emoji.to_awesome\n\n\n\n\nThis generator is another EmojiOne specific output called EmojiOne Awesome. It aims to give a font-awesome like interface for EmojiOne.  The \nemojione-awesome\n CDN currently follows this format: \nhttps://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/emojione@3.1.2/extras/css/emojione-awesome.css\n, so update accordingly.

The generator outputs the alt value directly to the document.  The output can be Unicode characters, HTML entities, or even just the short name depending on what the global setting of \nalt\n is set to.\n\n\n\ud83d\ude03\n\n\n\n\nThere are no generator specific options.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustom Emoji Indexes\n\ue157\n\n\nIn order to provide a custom index, the Emoji extension must be given a function that returns a suitable emoji index.  No parameters are passed to the function.  The function should simply return the custom index in the following format.\n\n\nemoji_index\n \n=\n \n{\n\n    \n# Name is the name of the index.

The format is shown below in case you need to create your own custom output generator.\n\n\n\n\ndef\n \nemoji_generator\n(\nindex\n,\n \nshortname\n,\n \nalias\n,\n \nuc\n,\n \nalt\n,\n \ntitle\n,\n \ncategory\n,\n \noptions\n,\n \nmd\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParameter\n\n\nType\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nindex\n\n\nstring\n\n\nThe name of the selected emoji index.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nshortname\n\n\nstring\n\n\nThe current short name.  This may differ from the actual name used in a document as aliases get translated to the main short name.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nalias\n\n\nstring\n\n\nIf the specified short name is an alias, that alias will be set here, and the main short name will be found under \nshortname\n.  This will be \nNone\n if the name used was not an alias.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nuc\n\n\nstring\n\n\nThis is a string representation of the Unicode, it could technically be anything as this is normally used to reference image files. So while some indexes will have this be code points, it may not contain code points at all or it may strip out code points for simpler image names. So the value here will not always be practical for calculating the actual Unicode points of an emoji.  This will be \nNone\n for non-standard emoji that are not Unicode.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nalt\n\n\nstring\n\n\nThis is the alternative emoji value (or fallback value).  Its format will differ depending on the extension setting \nalt\n and also the index being used. This will be returned as either the full valid Unicode characters or HTML entities, or it will be the short name used.  See the \nalt\n setting for more info.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntitle\n\n\nstring\n\n\nThis is the title that can be used in image elements.  Depending on the global extension setting \ntitle\n, this will either return the full long description, the short name, or \nNone\n.  See the \ntitle\n setting for more info.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncategory\n\n\nstring\n\n\nCategory of the emoji, or \nNone\n if there is no category for the emoji.\n\n\n\n\n\n\noptions\n\n\ndictionary\n\n\nThis is a dictionary to specify generator function specific options.  This can be anything, and it is up to the generator function to parse and provide defaults.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmd\n\n\nclass\n\n\nThis is the Markdown class object.  This is mainly used to access specific things needed from the Markdown class when formatting your output.  If you needed to stash your output, you would do something like: \nmd\n.\nhtmlStash\n.\nstore\n(\nalt\n,\n \nsafe\n=\nTrue\n)\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNon-Unicode emoji\n\n\nKeep in mind that Gemoji ships with some non-standard emoji like \n:octocat:\n that do not have Unicode code points.  \nuc\n and \nalt\n are affected by this and will return \nNone\n and the short name respectively instead of strings describing the Unicode points.  For example \n:octocat:\n will just return \nNone\n for \nuc\n and \n:octocat:\n for \nalt\n.  If you are parsing an index with custom emoji, like Gemoji has, then you need to be aware of this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing with MkDocs\n\ue157\n\n\nThis project uses these extensions with \nMkDocs\n to generate the documentation.  It might not be obvious how to set the index or generator functions in MkDocs' YAML settings file, but it is actually pretty easy.  The functions are referenced like you would import them in Python except you also append them with a special prefix to let the YAML module know that the setting value is a Python object.  For instance, to specify the \nto_svg\n generator, you would simply reference it like this: \n!!python/name:pymdownx.emoji.to_svg\n (or you could use your own custom module \n).\n\n\nmarkdown_extensions\n:\n\n  \n-\n \npymdownx.emoji\n:\n\n      \nemoji_generator\n:\n \n!!python/name:pymdownx.emoji.to_svg\n\n\n\n\n\nEmoji Index Updates\n\ue157\n\n\nThe Emoji extension might at times be behind on having indexes built from the latest repositories. We try to keep the indexes updated with new releases, but if they fall out of date, you can open an issue on the this project's issue page to alert the maintainer(s) and they will update them when someone gets a chance.  Pull requests are also welcome.  The process for updating the indexes is automated, so it is fairly easy to do a pull request.

These conventions differ because there is no official Unicode short name convention. At the present, Emoji chooses to focus on three specific emoji sets:   Gemoji  (     ): Gemoji is GitHub's open source emoji solution. It contains a lot of common emoji and a couple special, non Unicode emoji (like Gemoji's  :octocat: ). If you are a GitHub user, you are probably familiar with some of the short names associated with it. Their associated CDN contains the emoji in 75x75 PNG format.  EmojiOne  (     ): EmojiOne is a very complete, high quality emoji set with support for gender and skin tone modifiers. Their free emoji set includes PNGs in sizes of 32x32, 64x64, and 128x128 which are all available via a CDN. Their older (version 2.2.7) emoji set, which contains less emoji, offers SVG images as well. Emoji supports EmojiOne's newest short name mapping, but it can be used for their older set, but short names for emoji that have been added since the old set will not map to any images if this is done.  Twemoji  (     ): Twemoji is Twitter's open source emoji set which also covers a great many emoji with skin tones and gender modifiers. The hosted CDN provides 72x72 PNG emoji or SVG emoji. While Gemoji and EmojiOne have a short name convention, Twemoji does not, and there are currently no 3 rd  projects that provide short names anywhere close to all the provided emoji. Since EmojiOne has the largest emoji library of the supported sets, we use EmojiOne's short name list for Twemoji. There will be a reasonable attempt to patch in emoji not found in EmojiOne's index, but if EmojiOne is ever significantly behind, we may wait for EmojiOne to catch up.

SVG output is only supported for Twemoji and the older 2.2.7 EmojiOne set. PNG sprites and the \"Font Awesome\" like format are only supported by EmojiOne.  SVG sprites is only supported by the 2.2.7 EmojiOne.  You can select a generator to use by passing in one of the functions below via the  emoji_generator  parameter.  Pass the actual function reference, not a string. If you need to create your own, just check out  Custom Emoji Generators .   pymdownx.emoji.to_png   This is a general purpose generator which provides EmojiOne, GitHub, and Twemoji CDN path(s) out of the box. Depending on the index you've chosen, you the appropriate CDN will be provided.  If this ever gets out of date, a new CDN can be passed in via  image_path  and/or  non_standard_image_path . EmojiOne actually has multiple PNGs sizes of 32, 64, and 128, but the default CDN path is the one for size 64:  https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/64/ . You can change it for a larger or smaller PNG size by updating the size in the URL and passing the new URL in through  image_path . The PNG output form is as follows:  < img   alt = \"\ud83d\ude04\"   class = \"emojione\"   src = \"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/64/1f604.png\"   title = \":smile:\"   />   Generator Specific Options     Option  Type  Default  Description      classes  string  Name of the index used  Specifies the class(es) to be used in the image element.    image_path  string  CDN for the default index used  This can be either a local path or a CDN containing the assets.  By default, an appropriate CDN is provided for EmojiOne, Gemoji, and Twemoji depending on which index is being used.    non_standard_image_path  string  CDN for the default index used  This can be either a local path, or a CDN containing the assets. Currently, only Gemoji's non-standard emoji take advantage of this as the GitHub CDN alters the path slightly for its non-Unicode emoji.  By default, an appropriate CDN is provided for Gemoji.    attributes  dictionary  {}  A dictionary containing tag attributes as key value string pairs. The dictionary keys are the attribute names and dictionary values are the attribute values.      pymdownx.emoji.to_svg   This generator was written to output SVG images and supports EmojiOne and Twemoji. EmojiOne's SVG support is only for the free 2.2.7 release, so the default CDN still references the 2.2.7 release. EmojiOne short names added after 2.2.7 will not find images.  You can of course reference local SVG images as well by pointing  image_path  to them as well. The SVG image outputs as:  < img   alt = \"\ud83d\ude04\"   class = \"emojione\"   src = \"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/svg/1f604.svg\"   title = \":smile:\"   />   Generator Specific Options     Option  Type  Default  Description      classes  string  Name of the index used  Specifies the class(es) to be used in the image element.

By default, an appropriate CDN is provided for EmojiOne.    attributes  dictionary  {}  A dictionary containing tag attributes as key value string pairs. The dictionary keys are the attribute names and dictionary values are the attribute values.      pymdownx.emoji.to_png_sprite   This generator was written to support PNG sprite output for EmojiOne.  It is expected that this will be used in conjunction with the the official EmojiOne CSS.  You can include the CSS from the CDN in your document. The CSS comes in three sizes: 32, 64, 128. Make sure to set the correct size in the options to generate the appropriate classes.  Example CDN for the 3.1 version with 64px PNGs:  https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/sprites/emojione-sprite-64.min.css .  to_png_sprite  outputs the emoji as a span in the form below.  The CSS will apply the appropriate mapping in the sprite PNG to the background image of the span.  < span   class = \"emojione-64-people _1f604\"   title = \":smile:\" > \ud83d\ude04 </ span >   Generator Specific Options     Option  Type  Default  Description      classes  string  Name of the index used  Class(es) used for the span where the classes are inserted as \"class\" in the following template:  ' %(class)s - %(size)s - %(category)s  _ %(unicode)s ' .    size  int  64  Integer specifying the size for the class above.    attributes  dictionary  {}  A dictionary containing tag attributes as key value string pairs. The dictionary keys are the attribute names and dictionary values are the attribute values.      pymdownx.emoji.to_svg_sprite   This was written to support EmojiOne SVG sprite output.  The output form was taken directly from an example in the EmojiOne source.  It is expected that the the user will provide a local version of the official SVG sprite and the path to it.  Unfortunately there is no free 3.0 SVG sprite, so you will need to  download  the old 2.27 one. The output is:  < svg   class = \"emojione\" >< description > \ud83d\ude04 </ description >< use   xlink:href = \"./../assets/sprites/emojione.sprites.svg#emoji-1f604\" ></ use ></ svg >   Generator Specific Options     Option  Type  Default  Description      classes  string  Name of the index used  Class(es) to apply to the  svg  element where the classes are inserted as \"class\" in the following template:  ' %(class)s - %(unicode)s ' .    image_path  string  ''  Path to the SVG sprites.      pymdownx.emoji.to_awesome   This generator is another EmojiOne specific output called EmojiOne Awesome. It aims to give a font-awesome like interface for EmojiOne.  The  emojione-awesome  CDN currently follows this format:  https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/emojione@3.1.2/extras/css/emojione-awesome.css , so update accordingly.  The output format is:  < i   class = \"e1a-smile\" ></ i >   Generator Specific Options     Option  Type  Default  Description      classes  string  'e1a'  Class(es) to apply to the element where the classes are inserted as \"class\" in the following template:  ' %(class)s - %(shortname)s ' .    attributes  dictionary  {}  A dictionary containing tag attributes as key value string pairs. The dictionary keys are the attribute names and dictionary values are the attribute values.      pymdownx.emoji.to_alt   This generator supports all emoji indexes.  The generator outputs the alt value directly to the document.  The output can be Unicode characters, HTML entities, or even just the short name depending on what the global setting of  alt  is set to.  \ud83d\ude03  There are no generator specific options.",

This may differ from the actual name used in a document as aliases get translated to the main short name.    alias  string  If the specified short name is an alias, that alias will be set here, and the main short name will be found under  shortname .  This will be  None  if the name used was not an alias.    uc  string  This is a string representation of the Unicode, it could technically be anything as this is normally used to reference image files. So while some indexes will have this be code points, it may not contain code points at all or it may strip out code points for simpler image names. So the value here will not always be practical for calculating the actual Unicode points of an emoji.  This will be  None  for non-standard emoji that are not Unicode.    alt  string  This is the alternative emoji value (or fallback value).  Its format will differ depending on the extension setting  alt  and also the index being used. This will be returned as either the full valid Unicode characters or HTML entities, or it will be the short name used.  See the  alt  setting for more info.    title  string  This is the title that can be used in image elements.  Depending on the global extension setting  title , this will either return the full long description, the short name, or  None .  See the  title  setting for more info.    category  string  Category of the emoji, or  None  if there is no category for the emoji.    options  dictionary  This is a dictionary to specify generator function specific options.  This can be anything, and it is up to the generator function to parse and provide defaults.    md  class  This is the Markdown class object.  This is mainly used to access specific things needed from the Markdown class when formatting your output.  If you needed to stash your output, you would do something like:  md . htmlStash . store ( alt ,   safe = True ) .      Non-Unicode emoji  Keep in mind that Gemoji ships with some non-standard emoji like  :octocat:  that do not have Unicode code points.   uc  and  alt  are affected by this and will return  None  and the short name respectively instead of strings describing the Unicode points.  For example  :octocat:  will just return  None  for  uc  and  :octocat:  for  alt .  If you are parsing an index with custom emoji, like Gemoji has, then you need to be aware of this.",

Optionally, you can use either of these extensions and disable Pygments support to use your preferred JavaScript highlighter.\n\n\nIf using Pygments, you will also need to provide your preferred Pygments style. If using a JavaScript highlighter, you will have to read that highlighter's documentation to learn how to setup and style your code blocks appropriately.\n\n\nFor those looking for a GitHub theme, there is no GitHub style included with this extension. You are most likely able to find a suitable theme online by searching. Presently, there are GitHub styles found at the \npymdown-styles\n repository which contains the original Pygments GitHub style (\ngithub\n) and the GitHub 2014 style (\ngithub2014\n) which GitHub used before they abandoned Pygments for their own in-house highlighter. The listed themes might not always be available, and may not actually be close to current GitHub syntax highlighting.\n\n\nGitHub Like Slugs\n\ue157\n\n\nThe default slugify that Python Markdown uses isn't very much like GitHub's as it just removes all Unicode. But, at the time of writing this, the \ngfm\n slugify provided by PyMdown Extensions is pretty close in the way it handles Unicode in slugs. By passing in the \npymdownx.slugs.uslugify\n function via \nToc\n's slugify parameter, you can alter the slugs to be GitHub like.\n\n\nAs mentioned before, the GitHub extension does not intend to provide a 1:1 match of \nGFM\n. There is one small known difference that may never be directly addressed. GitHub appends a number to duplicate headers with a hyphen: \n-1\n. Python Markdown (through the \nToc\n extension) appends a number to duplicate headers with an underscore \n_1\n. Unfortunately, a slug function cannot simply override this duplicate as that behavior is controlled within the \nToc\n extension. There are no plans at this time to write a \nToc\n extension to replace the default one as a 1:1 match in behavior is not the end goal.\n\n\nGitHub Emoji Configuration\n\ue157\n\n\nThis is for informational purposes in case you wish to configure GitHub style emoji outside of the GitHub Extension. This is the full, default setup used to get GitHub emoji images.  This is valid at the time of writing this. GitHub uses Gemoji to provide their emoji, but GitHub also constantly tweaks how they do things, so in time this may render differently than what they actually do. This should provide emoji for as long as the CDNs are valid.\n\n\nimport\n \npymdownx.emoji\n\n\n\nextension_configs\n \n=\n \n{\n\n    \n\"pymdownx.emoji\"\n:\n \n{\n\n        \n\"emoji_index\"\n:\n \npymdownx\n.\nemoji\n.\ngemoji\n,\n\n        \n\"emoji_generator\"\n:\n \npymdownx\n.\nemoji\n.\nto_png\n,\n\n        \n\"alt\"\n:\n \n\"short\"\n,\n\n        \n\"options\"\n:\n \n{\n\n            \n\"attributes\"\n:\n \n{\n\n                \n\"align\"\n:\n \n\"absmiddle\"\n,\n\n                \n\"height\"\n:\n \n\"20px\"\n,\n\n                \n\"width\"\n:\n \n\"20px\"\n\n            \n},\n\n            \n\"image_path\"\n:\n \n\"https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/\"\n,\n\n            \n\"non_standard_image_path\"\n:\n \n\"https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/\"\n\n        \n}\n\n    \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nOptions\n\ue157\n\n\nIf you wish to configure the individual extensions included via this extensions, you can configure them by placing that sub extension's settings under a setting value that equals the sub extensions name.\n\n\nextension_configs\n \n=\n \n{\n\n    \n'pymdownx.github'\n:\n \n{\n\n        \n'pymdownx.tilde'\n:\n \n{\n\n            \n'subscript'\n:\n \nTrue\n\n        \n}\n\n    \n}\n\n\n}",

For those looking for a GitHub theme, there is no GitHub style included with this extension. You are most likely able to find a suitable theme online by searching. Presently, there are GitHub styles found at the  pymdown-styles  repository which contains the original Pygments GitHub style ( github ) and the GitHub 2014 style ( github2014 ) which GitHub used before they abandoned Pygments for their own in-house highlighter.

GitHub appends a number to duplicate headers with a hyphen:  -1 . Python Markdown (through the  Toc  extension) appends a number to duplicate headers with an underscore  _1 . Unfortunately, a slug function cannot simply override this duplicate as that behavior is controlled within the  Toc  extension.

PyMdown Extensions chooses not to implement special language headers for standard Markdown code blocks like CodeHilite does; PyMdown Extensions takes the position that language headers are better suited in fenced code blocks.

If you wish to highlight lines and define line numbers per code block, it is advised to use the SuperFences extension.

This is so you can target it or the elements under it with CSS. Each recognized key press has its own special key class assigned to it in the form \nkey-<key name>\n. These individual key classes are great if you want to show special modifier key symbols before the key text (which is done in this documentation).

This is so you can target it or the elements under it with CSS. Each recognized key press has its own special key class assigned to it in the form  key-<key name> . These individual key classes are great if you want to show special modifier key symbols before the key text (which is done in this documentation). The wrapper  keys  class can be customized with options, and the individual key classes are generated from the  key-map index .  If you would like to generate a key which isn't in the key index, you can extend the key map via a special  option .  But if you don't need a key with a special class generated, or you need a way to quickly enter a one time special key, you can just insert it directly by quoting the text you want displayed instead of a key name.

            "text": "MagicLink\n\ue157\n\n\nOverview\n\ue157\n\n\nMagicLink is an extension that provides a number of useful link related features. MagicLink can auto-link HTML, FTP, and email links. It can auto-convert repository links (GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket) and display them in a more concise, shorthand format. MagicLink can also be configured to directly auto-link the aforementioned shorthand format.\n\n\nIf you happen to have some conflicts with syntax for a specific case, you can always revert to the old auto-link format as well: \n<https://www.link.com>\n. If enabled, repository link shortening will be applied to the the angle bracketed auto-link format as well.\n\n\nAuto-Linking\n\ue157\n\n\nMagicLink supports auto-linking HTTP, FTP and email links. You can specify these links in raw text and they should get auto-linked. There are some limitations placed on MagicLink to keep it from aggressively auto-linking text that is not part of links. If you have a link that cannot be detected, you can always use the old style angle bracketed link format: \n<https://www.link.com>\n.\n\n\n\n\nAuto-Linking Example\n\n\n- Just paste links directly in the document like this: https://google.com.\n- Or even an email address: fake.email@email.com.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJust paste links directly in the document like this: \nhttps://google.com\n.\n\n\nOr even an email address: \nfake.email@email.com\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShorthand Links\n\ue157\n\n\nMagicLink supports shorthand references for GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket issues (\n#1\n), pull/merge requests (\n!13\n), commits (\n7d1b190\n), and compares (\ne2ed7e0...90b6fb8\n). You can also reference repositories (\nfacelessuser/pymdown-extensions\n) and it supports mentioning users (\n@facelessuser\n). Mentions also works for social media (only Twitter is supported at this time).\n\n\nThe syntax for repository providers is actually very similar to GitLab's syntax. GitLab was chosen as its syntax bridges the gaps between the three providers. GitLab and Bitbucket require a pull specific syntax while GitHub does not have one. I also preferred the subtle differences in GitLab's commit references as it was consistent with pull and issue syntax.\n\n\nConfiguring\n\ue157\n\n\nTo enable shorthand syntax for code repository providers and social media providers, enable \nrepo_url_shorthand\n and \nsocial_url_shorthand\n respectively in the \noptions\n.\n\n\nTo use this feature you must first specify in the \noptions\n your \nprovider\n to which all shorthand references are relative to, but you will still be able to reference outside of your defaults. And if you are specifying a code repository provider as your default, you must also specify the \nuser\n and \nrepo\n (repository) which adds more context and allows you to shorten the syntax even more for issues relating to your default \nuser\n and/or \nrepo\n. This is useful if you are using MagicLink to write documentation for a project that is hosted on one of the supported code repository providers.\n\n\nIf you are using this extension more generally, it may make more sense to set a social media provider as the default \nprovider\n. There is no need to set a \nuser\n or \nrepo\n for a social media provider as the context is not useful for mentions. You will still be able to reference repository links with shorthand if it enabled, albeit in a longer format.\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nLinks are not verified, so make sure you are specifying valid issues, repositories, and users as they will be auto-linked even if they are not valid.\n\n\n\n\nMentions\n\ue157\n\n\nMentions of other users are performed with the following syntax: \n@{user}\n. To reference a provider other than your default, use the format \n@{provider}:{user}\n\n\n\n\nMention Example\n\n\n@facelessuser\n\n@twitter:twitter\n\n\n\n\n@facelessuser\n\n\n@twitter\n\n\n\n\nFor code repository providers, you can also mention repositories.  This feature is actually inspired by the GitHub only extension \nPython-Markdown/github-links\n, which performs \nsimilar\n auto-linking.  The syntax to auto-link a repository with mentioning is very similar to auto-linking a user, except you append the repository to the user name like so: \n@{user}/{repo}\n. If specifying a non-default provider, the form would look like: \n@{provider}:{user}/{repo}\n. The output for repository mentions omits the \n@\n symbol and will just show the user and repository, but you are free to style it with CSS to make it stand out more like has been done in this document.\n\n\n\n\nRepository Mention Example\n\n\n@facelessuser/pymdown-extensions\n\n@gitlab:pycqa/flake8\n\n\n\n\nfacelessuser/pymdown-extensions\n\n\npycqa/flake8\n\n\n\n\nIssues and Pull Requests\n\ue157\n\n\nIssues and pull requests are specified with \n#{num}\n and \n!{num}\n respectively. To specify an issue for a non-default repository under the default user, prefix the repository: \n{repo}#{num}\n. And to specify a repository under a non-default user, prefix both the user and repository: \n{user}/{repo}#{num}\n. And to reference an external provider, use the format \n{provider}:{user}/{repo}#{num}\n. If the default provider is a social media provider, then only the latter syntax can be used.\n\n\n\n\nIssue Example\n\n\nIssue #1\n\nIssue backrefs#1\n\nIssue Python-Markdown/markdown#1\n\nIssue gitlab:pycqa/flake8#385\n\nPull request !13\n\nPull request backrefs!4\n\nPull request Python-Markdown/markdown!598\n\nPull request gitlab:pycqa/flake8!213\n\n\n\n\nIssue \n#1\n\n\nIssue \nbackrefs#1\n\n\nIssue \nPython-Markdown/markdown#1\n\n\nIssue \npycqa/flake8#385\n\n\nPull request \n!13\n\n\nPull request \nbackrefs!4\n\n\nPull request \nPython-Markdown/markdown!598\n\n\nPull request \npycqa/flake8!213\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nGitHub actually gives pull requests and issues unique values while GitLab and Bitbucket can have pulls with the same ID as an issue. So with GitHub, you can use \n#{num}\n format for both issues and pulls, and GitHub will redirect you to the appropriate issue or pull.\n\n\nGitLab and Bitbucket \nmust\n specify pulls different from issues, hence the \n!13\n format. Though GitHub doesn't \nneed\n to use the pull format, you can if you like. This format was actually borrowed from GitLab.\n\n\n\n\nCommits\n\ue157\n\n\nCommit shorthand syntax is simply the 40 character commit hash value: \n{hash}\n. And much like issues and pull requests, you can denote a repository under the default user with \n{repo}@{hash}\n and a repository under a non-default user with \n{user}/{repo}@{hash}\n. Lastly, to reference an external provider, use the format \n{provider}:{user}/{repo}@{hash}\n. If the default provider is a social media provider, then only the latter syntax can be used.\n\n\n\n\nCommit Example\n\n\n181c06d1f11fa29961b334e90606ed1f1ec7a7cc\n\nbackrefs@cb4ecc5e7d8f7cdff0bb4482174f2ff0dcc35c61\n\nPython-Markdown/markdown@de5c696f94e8dde242c29d4be50b7bbf3c17fedb\n\ngitlab:pycqa/flake8@8acf55e0f85233c51c291816d73d828cc62d30d1\n\n\n\n\n181c06d\n\n\nbackrefs@cb4ecc5\n\n\nPython-Markdown/markdown@de5c696\n\n\npycqa/flake8@8acf55e0\n\n\n\n\nDiff/Compare\n\ue157\n\n\nGitLab offers a useful shorthand to specify links to compare differences between two commits. This has been adopted for all the supported repository providers.\n\n\nSpecifying a compare link is very similar to specifying a commit link except you must specify the older hash and the newer hash separated by \n...\n: \n{hash1}...{hash2}\n. To specify a compare for a non-default repository under the default user, prefix the repository: \n{repo}@{hash1}...{hash2}\n. And to specify a compare under a non-default user, prefix both the user and repository: \n{user}/{repo}@{hash1}...{hash2}\n. Lastly, to reference an external provider, use the format \n{provider}:{user}/{repo}@{hash1}...{hash2}\n.\n\n\n\n\nCompare Example\n\n\ne2ed7e0b3973f3f9eb7a26b8ef7ae514eebfe0d2...90b6fb8711e75732f987982cc024e9bb0111beac\n\nbackrefs@88c6238a1c2cf71a96eb9abb4b0213f79d6ca81f...cb4ecc5e7d8f7cdff0bb4482174f2ff0dcc35c61\n\nPython-Markdown/markdown@007bd2aa4c184b28f710d041a0abe78bffc0ec2e...de5c696f94e8dde242c29d4be50b7bbf3c17fedb\n\ngitlab:pycqa/flake8@1ecf97005a024391fb07ad8941f4d25c4e0aae6e...9bea7576ac33a8e4f72f87ffa81dfa10256fca6e\n\n\n\n\ne2ed7e0...90b6fb8\n\n\nbackrefs@88c6238...cb4ecc5\n\n\nPython-Markdown/markdown@007bd2a...de5c696\n\n\npycqa/flake8@1ecf9700...9bea7576\n\n\n\n\nRepository Link Shortener\n\ue157\n\n\nMagicLink can also recognize issue, pull request, commit, and compare links, and render them in the same output format as the \nrepository shortcut links\n feature. Unfortunately, mention link shortening is not presently supported due to the fact that MagicLink does not use any of the providers' API to verify user links, and some legitimate links can look like user links, but are not.\n\n\nIf we specify long form URLs from external providers, they will be shortened appropriately.\n\n\n\n\nExternal Provider Example\n\n\n- https://gitlab.com/pycqa/flake8/issues/385\n- https://bitbucket.org/mrabarnett/mrab-regex/issues/260/extremely-slow-matching-using-ignorecase\n\n\n\n\n\n\npycqa/flake8#385\n\n\nmrabarnett/mrab-regex#260\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen specifying links that reference the configured \nprovider\n, \nuser\n, and \nrepo\n, links will be shortened differently in light of that context.\n\n\n\n\nInternal Provider Example\n\n\n- https://github.com/facelessuser/pymdown-extensions/issues/1\n- https://github.com/facelessuser/pymdown-extensions/pull/13\n- https://github.com/facelessuser/pymdown-extensions/commit/3f6b07a8eeaa9d606115758d90f55fec565d4e2a\n- https://github.com/facelessuser/pymdown-extensions/compare/e2ed7e0b3973f3f9eb7a26b8ef7ae514eebfe0d2...90b6fb8711e75732f987982cc024e9bb0111beac\n- https://github.com/facelessuser/Rummage/commit/181c06d1f11fa29961b334e90606ed1f1ec7a7cc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#1\n\n\n!13\n\n\n3f6b07a\n\n\ne2ed7e0...90b6fb8\n\n\nRummage@181c06d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCSS\n\ue157\n\n\nFor normal links, no classes are added to the anchor tags.

            "text": "Snippets\n\ue157\n\n\nOverview\n\ue157\n\n\nSnippets is an extension to insert markdown or HTML snippets into another markdown file.  Snippets is great for situations where you have content you need to insert into multiple documents.  For instance, this document keeps all its hyperlinks in a separate file.  Then includes those hyperlinks at the bottom of a document via snippets. If a link needs to be updated, it can be updated in one location instead of updating them in multiple files.\n\n\nSnippets is run as a preprocessor, so if a snippet is found in a fenced code block etc., it will still get processed.  If the specified file cannot be found, the the markup will be removed.  If you need to show a snippet example in fenced code, please escape it as listed in \nSnippets Notation\n.\n\n\nSnippets can handle recursive file inclusion.  And if Snippets encounters the same file in the current stack, it will avoid re-processing it in order to avoid an infinite loop (or crash on hitting max recursion depth).  Though it should be said, you should extreme recursion depth as you will hit Python's recursion limit.\n\n\nThis is meant for simple file inclusion, it has no intention to implement features from complex template systems. If you need something more complex, you may consider using a template environment to process your files \nbefore\n feeding them through Python Markdown.  If you are using a document generation system, this can likely be performed via a plugin for that document system (assuming a plugin environment is available).\n\n\nSnippets Notation\n\ue157\n\n\nSnippets has two modes of inserting snippets: single line and block.\n\n\nSingle line format is done by placing the following markup for the single line notation:\n\n\n--8<-- \"filename.md\" \n\n\n\n\nOr you can insert multiple files with block notation:\n\n\n--8<-- \nfilename.md\nfilename2.md\n--8<-- \n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, the notation is ASCII scissors cutting a line followed by the file name.  In the case of the single line variant, the file name follows directly after the scissors and is quoted.  In the case of the block format, the file names follow on separate lines and an additional scissor is added afterwards to signal the end of the block.\n\n\nThe dashes can be as few as 2 (\n--8<--\n) or longer if desired (\n---8<---------\n); whatever your preference is.  The important thing is that the notation must reside on a line(s) by itself, and the path must be quoted in the case of the single line notation.  If the file name is indented, the content will be indented to that level as well.  To reduce confusion in block format, it is advised to ensure the entire block is indented to the same level.  If you need to escape the syntax, just make sure a minimum of a space is after the quoted file name for single line format, or a space after the start or end block markers in block format.\n\n\n--8<-- \"escaped notation\"<space>\n\n--8<--<space>\nescaped notation\n--8<--<space>\n\n\n\n\nIf you have a file you want to temporarily ignore, you can comment it out by prepending the path with \n;\n (notice the semicolon is followed by a space).  This works for both single line and block format:\n\n\n--8<-- \"; skip.md\" \n\n--8<-- \ninclude.md\n; skip.md\n--8<-- \n\n\n\n\nFormatting Snippets\n\ue157\n\n\nWhen inserting your snippet, it is important to remember that some snippets may need whitespace around them.\n\n\nThis is the file that is including the snippet.\nWe want blank lines before and after the insertion:\n\n--8<-- \"insert.md\" \n\nSo we put blank lines around the insertion.\n\n\n\n\nIn block format, it is important to note that empty lines are preserved for formatting:\n\n\n--8<-- \nfile1.md\n\nfile2.md\n--8<-- \n\n\n\n\nOptions\n\ue157\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOption\n\n\nType\n\n\nDefault\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbase_path\n\n\nstring\n\n\n'.'\n\n\nA string indicating a base path to be used resolve snippet locations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nencoding\n\n\nstring\n\n\n'utf-8'\n\n\nEncoding to use when reading in the snippets.",

            "text": "Snippets is an extension to insert markdown or HTML snippets into another markdown file.  Snippets is great for situations where you have content you need to insert into multiple documents.  For instance, this document keeps all its hyperlinks in a separate file.  Then includes those hyperlinks at the bottom of a document via snippets. If a link needs to be updated, it can be updated in one location instead of updating them in multiple files.  Snippets is run as a preprocessor, so if a snippet is found in a fenced code block etc., it will still get processed.  If the specified file cannot be found, the the markup will be removed.  If you need to show a snippet example in fenced code, please escape it as listed in  Snippets Notation .  Snippets can handle recursive file inclusion.  And if Snippets encounters the same file in the current stack, it will avoid re-processing it in order to avoid an infinite loop (or crash on hitting max recursion depth).  Though it should be said, you should extreme recursion depth as you will hit Python's recursion limit.  This is meant for simple file inclusion, it has no intention to implement features from complex template systems. If you need something more complex, you may consider using a template environment to process your files  before  feeding them through Python Markdown.  If you are using a document generation system, this can likely be performed via a plugin for that document system (assuming a plugin environment is available).",

            "text": "Snippets has two modes of inserting snippets: single line and block.  Single line format is done by placing the following markup for the single line notation:  --8<-- \"filename.md\"   Or you can insert multiple files with block notation:  --8<-- \nfilename.md\nfilename2.md\n--8<--   As you can see, the notation is ASCII scissors cutting a line followed by the file name.  In the case of the single line variant, the file name follows directly after the scissors and is quoted.  In the case of the block format, the file names follow on separate lines and an additional scissor is added afterwards to signal the end of the block.  The dashes can be as few as 2 ( --8<-- ) or longer if desired ( ---8<--------- ); whatever your preference is.  The important thing is that the notation must reside on a line(s) by itself, and the path must be quoted in the case of the single line notation.  If the file name is indented, the content will be indented to that level as well.  To reduce confusion in block format, it is advised to ensure the entire block is indented to the same level.  If you need to escape the syntax, just make sure a minimum of a space is after the quoted file name for single line format, or a space after the start or end block markers in block format.  --8<-- \"escaped notation\"<space>\n\n--8<--<space>\nescaped notation\n--8<--<space>  If you have a file you want to temporarily ignore, you can comment it out by prepending the path with  ;  (notice the semicolon is followed by a space).  This works for both single line and block format:  --8<-- \"; skip.md\" \n\n--8<-- \ninclude.md\n; skip.md\n--8<--",

If start is 3 backticks, the fence will end with 3 backticks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStart and end fence boundaries must be aligned to the same indentation level.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContent between fences must be indented at least the same amount as the start and end boundaries.  Empty lines are exempted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are using a fenced block inside a blockquote, at the very least, the first line of the fenced block needs to have the appropriate number of \n>\n characters signifying the quote depth.\n\n\n> ```\n  a fenced block\n  ```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToo many blank lines will cause a blockquote to terminate, so remember to use \n>\n markers accordingly if not marking every line.\n\n\n> ```\n  a fenced block\n\n> with blank lines\n  ```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf using a fenced block as the first line of a list, you will have to leave the first line blank, but remember that the list marker must be followed by a space.\n\n\n-<space>\n    ```\n    a fenced block\n    ```\n\nDefinition\n:<space>\n    ```\n    a fenced block\n    ```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFenced blocks should be separated from other blocks by an empty line.\n\n\nParagraph.\n\n```\na fenced block\n```\n\nAnother paragraph.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode Highlighting\n\ue157\n\n\nAssuming Pygments is installed, code highlighting will be handled by \nPygments\n by default. If Pygments is not installed, or disabled, code blocks will be created using HTML5 style tags for a JavaScript syntax highlighter: \n<\npre\n \nclass\n=\n\"highlight\"\n><\ncode\n \nclass\n=\n\"language-mylanguage\"\n></\ncode\n></\npre\n>\n. If you disable \nhighlight_code\n, specified languages will be ignored, and the content will be wrapped in a simple \npre\n and \ncode\n tags with no classes.\n\n\nHighlighting can be further controlled if either the \npymdownx.highlight\n extension is used or if Python Markdown's CodeHilite is used. If CodeHilite is configured, it's settings will be used to configure highlighting, but CodeHilite support is deprecated and will be removed in the next major release. It is recommended to instead use \npymdownx.highlight\n extension. If \npymdownx.highlight\n is included and configured, CodeHilite will be ignored.\n\n\nWhen using fenced code blocks, you can specify a specific syntax language to highlight with by specifying the language name directly after the opening tokens (either \n```\n or \n~~~\n). Whether using Pygments or some other JavaScript highlighter, the syntax is the same, but please consult your highlighter's documentation for recognized language syntax specifiers.\n\n\n\n\nHighlight Example\n\n\n```python\nimport foo.bar\n```\n\n\n\n\nimport\n \nfoo.bar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShowing Line Numbers\n\ue157\n\n\nLine numbers are provided via Pygments and can either be shown per code block or globally for all. To show globally via CodeHilite or \npymdownx.highlight\n, you must set \nlinenums\n to \nTrue\n in the respective extension.\n\n\nTo set line numbers per code block, you can specify a special setting directly after the opening tokens (and language if present). Simply specify the starting line line number with option \nlinenums=\"1\"\n. The setting is followed by the equal sign and the value must be quoted.  Valid line numbers are n > 0.  If \nlinenums\n is enabled globally, this will just control the starting line shown in the block.\n\n\n\n\nLine Number Example\n\n\n``` linenums=\"1\"\nimport foo.bar\n```\n\n\n\n\n1\nimport foo.bar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPygments also has a few additional options in regards to line numbers. One is \"line step\" which, if set to a number n > 1, will print only every n\nth\n line number. The other option is a setting that can mark line numbers as \"special\" with a span and class \nspecial\n. If the special parameter is set to a number n > 0, every n\nth\n line number is given the CSS class \nspecial\n.\n\n\nSo to set showing only every other line number, we could do the following. Line options are separated by a space, and \"line step\" is always the second option, so you must specify line start before line step.\n\n\nPygments currently implements this a little weird and doesn't pad the first line number, so don't be surprised if line numbers don't quite line up correctly. Hopefully Pygments will fix this in the future.\n\n\n\n\nNth Line Example\n\n\n``` linenums=\"2 2\"\n\"\"\"Some file.\"\"\"\nimport foo.bar\nimport boo.baz\nimport foo.bar.baz\n```\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n4\n\n\"\"\"Some file.\"\"\"\nimport foo.bar\nimport boo.baz\nimport foo.bar.baz\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo set every other line as special, you must set the third \nlinenums\n option (specify line start and step before it). Special must be a value of n > 0.\n\n\n\n\nSpecial Line Example\n\n\n``` linenums=\"1 1 2\"\n\"\"\"Some file.\"\"\"\nimport foo.bar\nimport boo.baz\nimport foo.bar.baz\n```\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\"\"\"Some file.\"\"\"\nimport foo.bar\nimport boo.baz\nimport foo.bar.baz\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor JavaScript libraries, a class of \nlinenums\n is written to the block.  This may or may not be leveraged by your chosen highlighter.  It is uncertain at this time whether line number support for JavaScript highlighters will be enhanced beyond this.\n\n\nHighlighting Lines\n\ue157\n\n\nVia Pygments, certain lines can be specified for highlighting.  This is done by specifying a special setting directly after the opening tokens (and language if present).  The setting is named \nhl_lines\n and the value should be the targeted line numbers separated by spaces.\n\n\n\n\nHighlight Lines Example\n\n\n``` hl_lines=\"1 3\"\n\"\"\"Some file.\"\"\"\nimport foo.bar\nimport boo.baz\nimport foo.bar.baz\n```\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"Some file.\"\"\"\n\nimport foo.bar\n\nimport boo.baz\n\nimport foo.bar.baz\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLine numbers are always referenced starting at 1 ignoring what the line number is labeled as when showing line numbers.\n\n\n\n\nHighlight with Line Numbers Example\n\n\n``` hl_lines=\"1 3\" linenums=\"2\"\n\"\"\"Some file.\"\"\"\nimport foo.bar\nimport boo.baz\nimport foo.bar.baz\n```\n\n\n\n\n2\n3\n4\n5\n\"\"\"Some file.\"\"\"\n\nimport foo.bar\n\nimport boo.baz\n\nimport foo.bar.baz\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustom Fences\n\ue157\n\n\nSuperFences allows defining custom fences for special purposes, like flow charts and sequence diagrams:\n\n\n\n\nFlow Chart Example\n\n\n```flow\nst=>start: Start:>http://www.google.com[blank]\ne=>end:>http://www.google.com\nop1=>operation: My Operation\nsub1=>subroutine: My Subroutine\ncond=>condition: Yes\nor No?:>http://www.google.com\nio=>inputoutput: catch something...\n\nst->op1->cond\ncond(yes)->io->e\ncond(no)->sub1(right)->op1\n```\n\n\n\n\nst=>start: Start:>http://www.google.com[blank]\ne=>end:>http://www.google.com\nop1=>operation: My Operation\nsub1=>subroutine: My Subroutine\ncond=>condition: Yes\nor No?:>http://www.google.com\nio=>inputoutput: catch something...\n\nst->op1->cond\ncond(yes)->io->e\ncond(no)->sub1(right)->op1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSequence Diagram Example\n\n\n```sequence\nTitle: Here is a title\nA->B: Normal line\nB-->C: Dashed line\nC->>D: Open arrow\nD-->>A: Dashed open arrow\n```\n\n\n\n\nTitle: Here is a title\nA->B: Normal line\nB-->C: Dashed line\nC->>D: Open arrow\nD-->>A: Dashed open arrow\n\n\n\n\n\nAs shown above, SuperFences defines two default custom fences (which can be removed if desired) called \nflow\n and \nsequence\n, for flowcharts and sequence diagrams respectively. The default custom fences simply preserve the content between the fences so a JavaScript UML library can convert the content and render the UML. To see \nexactly\n how to set up UML like in this documentation, see \nUML Diagram Example\n.\n\n\nCustom fences are created via the \ncustom_fences\n option.  \ncustom_fences\n takes an array of dictionaries where each dictionary defines a custom fence. The dictionaries requires the following keys:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeys\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nname\n\n\nThe language name that is specified when using the fence in Markdown.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nclass\n\n\nThe class name assigned to the HTML element when converting from Markdown to HTML.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nformat\n\n\nA function that formats the HTML output.  Should return a string as HTML.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuperFences provides two format functions by default, but you can always write your own:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormat\u00a0Function\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsuperfences.fence_code_format\n\n\nPlaces the HTML escaped content of the fence under a \n<\npre\n><\ncode\n>\n block.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsuperfences.fence_div_format\n\n\nPlaces the HTML escaped content of the fence under a \n<\ndiv\n>\n block.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUML Diagram Example\n\ue157\n\n\nThis example illustrates how this document uses the \ncustom_fences\n option to do UML diagrams.  Out of the box, SuperFences use the default settings for \ncustom_fences\n for the purpose of including UML. The settings below show the default settings, which define two new custom languages called \nflow\n and \nsequence\n. The \nflow\n and \nsequence\n fences will pass the content through the \nsuperfences.fence_code_format\n format function which will wrap the content in \n<\npre\n><\ncode\n blocks and attach the class \numl-flowchart\n or \numl-sequence-diagram\n to the respective \n<\npre\n>\n block. \nsuperfences.fence_div_format\n could just as easily be used to wrap the content in a \n<\ndiv\n>\n instead, or a new custom function could have been written and used.\n\n\ncustom_fences\n \n=\n \n[\n\n    \n{\n'name'\n:\n \n'flow'\n,\n \n'class'\n:\n \n'uml-flowchart'\n,\n \n'format'\n:\n \nsuperfences\n.\nfence_code_format\n},\n\n    \n{\n'name'\n:\n \n'sequence'\n,\n \n'class'\n:\n \n'uml-sequence-diagram'\n,\n \n'format'\n:\n \nsuperfences\n.\nfence_code_format\n}\n\n\n]\n\n\n\n\n\nAs defined above, the custom UML diagrams are recognized when defining a fenced code block with either the language \nflow\n or \nsequence\n.  When they are converted, the HTML element containing this content will have the respective classes \numl-flowchart\n or \numl-sequence-diagram\n. The format function we used in this example only escapes the content to be included in HTML. We will rely on JavaScript libraries to render our flowcharts/diagrams in the browser.\n\n\nThe JavaScript libraries used to render UML in this document are \nflowchart.js\n and \nsequence-diagram.js\n. This extension does not provide these JavaScript libraries; you must provide the necessary JavaScript files for your custom fences yourself. If you wish to follow along with this example to enable UML, see the requirements below.\n\n\n\n\nflowcharts\n\n\n\n\n\n\nraphael.js\n\n\nflowchart.js\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsequence diagrams\n\n\n\n\nMinimum requirements for the latest version available via CDN (at the time of writing this).\n\n\n\n\nraphael.js\n\n\nunderscore.js\n\n\nsequence-diagram.js\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll of the above mentioned libraries can be included using CDNs (you can use the version of your choice):\n\n\n<\nscript\n \nsrc\n=\n\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/raphael/2.2.7/raphael.min.js\"\n></\nscript\n>\n\n\n<\nscript\n \nsrc\n=\n\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/underscore.js/1.8.3/underscore-min.js\"\n></\nscript\n>\n\n\n<\nscript\n \nsrc\n=\n\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/js-sequence-diagrams/1.0.6/sequence-diagram-min.js\"\n></\nscript\n>\n\n\n<\nscript\n \nsrc\n=\n\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/flowchart/1.6.5/flowchart.min.js\"\n></\nscript\n>\n\n\n\n\n\nSimply including the libraries above is not enough as these libraries need to be pointed at the elements they need to convert.  Also, we need to configure the libraries with the settings we would like.\n\n\nAs mentioned earlier, our flowchart elements have the \numl-flowchart\n class assigned to them, and the sequence diagram elements have the \numl-sequence-diagram\n class assigned to them. Below shows an example script to convert the UML diagrams for both flowcharts and sequence diagrams using the listed libraries above. This script will target the elements with the classes \numl-flowchart\n and \numl-sequence-diagram\n. The script will pass the content to the correct library to render the content.  It will then insert the rendered UML and remove the original source. This is just an example, and you are not required to use the following script. You are free to modify the example script or write your own to suite your specific custom fence.\n\n\nIn the below example we create an \nonReady\n function to execute the conversion when the HTML is loaded.  We create a \nconvertUML\n function that takes the class name to search for, the converter to use, and a settings object to feed into the converter.  We then call \nonReady\n and feed it a callback function that will execute \nconvertUML\n for flowcharts and for sequence diagrams. Notice that \nconvertUML\n can handle both the \n<\npre\n><\ncode\n>\n format or the \n<\ndiv\n>\n format we mentioned earlier.\n\n\nThe actual \nconvertUML\n function reads UML instructions from our element and sticks it in a div that gets appended to our main HTML content (in this case we look for the the \nbody\n tag, but it could be anything).

Normally Python Markdown does not parse content inside HTML tags unless they are marked with the attribute \nmarkdown='1'\n.  But since this is run as a preprocessor, it is not aware of the HTML blocks.\n\n\nSuperFences is made to work with the default extensions out of the box.  It will probably not work with other extensions such as Grid Tables, since that extension allows for characters to obscure the blocks like the blockquote syntax does (though this has been designed to work with blockquotes).  Ideally fenced blocks need to be handled by a block parser, but there is much work to be done on Python Markdown's internal block handlers before this is possible.\n\n\nSuperFences works best when following the guidelines.  If the guidelines are not followed, odd results may be encountered.\n\n\nFor the reasons above, the nested fences feature really is just a workaround.

If you disable  highlight_code , specified languages will be ignored, and the content will be wrapped in a simple  pre  and  code  tags with no classes.  Highlighting can be further controlled if either the  pymdownx.highlight  extension is used or if Python Markdown's CodeHilite is used. If CodeHilite is configured, it's settings will be used to configure highlighting, but CodeHilite support is deprecated and will be removed in the next major release. It is recommended to instead use  pymdownx.highlight  extension. If  pymdownx.highlight  is included and configured, CodeHilite will be ignored.  When using fenced code blocks, you can specify a specific syntax language to highlight with by specifying the language name directly after the opening tokens (either  ```  or  ~~~ ). Whether using Pygments or some other JavaScript highlighter, the syntax is the same, but please consult your highlighter's documentation for recognized language syntax specifiers.

            "text": "Line numbers are provided via Pygments and can either be shown per code block or globally for all. To show globally via CodeHilite or  pymdownx.highlight , you must set  linenums  to  True  in the respective extension.  To set line numbers per code block, you can specify a special setting directly after the opening tokens (and language if present). Simply specify the starting line line number with option  linenums=\"1\" . The setting is followed by the equal sign and the value must be quoted.  Valid line numbers are n > 0.  If  linenums  is enabled globally, this will just control the starting line shown in the block.   Line Number Example  ``` linenums=\"1\"\nimport foo.bar\n```  1 import foo.bar    Pygments also has a few additional options in regards to line numbers. One is \"line step\" which, if set to a number n > 1, will print only every n th  line number. The other option is a setting that can mark line numbers as \"special\" with a span and class  special . If the special parameter is set to a number n > 0, every n th  line number is given the CSS class  special .  So to set showing only every other line number, we could do the following. Line options are separated by a space, and \"line step\" is always the second option, so you must specify line start before line step.  Pygments currently implements this a little weird and doesn't pad the first line number, so don't be surprised if line numbers don't quite line up correctly. Hopefully Pygments will fix this in the future.   Nth Line Example  ``` linenums=\"2 2\"\n\"\"\"Some file.\"\"\"\nimport foo.bar\nimport boo.baz\nimport foo.bar.baz\n```  2\n\n4 \"\"\"Some file.\"\"\"\nimport foo.bar\nimport boo.baz\nimport foo.bar.baz    To set every other line as special, you must set the third  linenums  option (specify line start and step before it). Special must be a value of n > 0.   Special Line Example  ``` linenums=\"1 1 2\"\n\"\"\"Some file.\"\"\"\nimport foo.bar\nimport boo.baz\nimport foo.bar.baz\n```  1 2 \n3 4 \"\"\"Some file.\"\"\"\nimport foo.bar\nimport boo.baz\nimport foo.bar.baz    For JavaScript libraries, a class of  linenums  is written to the block.  This may or may not be leveraged by your chosen highlighter.  It is uncertain at this time whether line number support for JavaScript highlighters will be enhanced beyond this.",

The default custom fences simply preserve the content between the fences so a JavaScript UML library can convert the content and render the UML. To see  exactly  how to set up UML like in this documentation, see  UML Diagram Example .  Custom fences are created via the  custom_fences  option.   custom_fences  takes an array of dictionaries where each dictionary defines a custom fence. The dictionaries requires the following keys:     Keys  Description      name  The language name that is specified when using the fence in Markdown.    class  The class name assigned to the HTML element when converting from Markdown to HTML.    format  A function that formats the HTML output.  Should return a string as HTML.

            "text": "This example illustrates how this document uses the  custom_fences  option to do UML diagrams.  Out of the box, SuperFences use the default settings for  custom_fences  for the purpose of including UML. The settings below show the default settings, which define two new custom languages called  flow  and  sequence . The  flow  and  sequence  fences will pass the content through the  superfences.fence_code_format  format function which will wrap the content in  < pre >< code  blocks and attach the class  uml-flowchart  or  uml-sequence-diagram  to the respective  < pre >  block.  superfences.fence_div_format  could just as easily be used to wrap the content in a  < div >  instead, or a new custom function could have been written and used.  custom_fences   =   [ \n     { 'name' :   'flow' ,   'class' :   'uml-flowchart' ,   'format' :   superfences . fence_code_format }, \n     { 'name' :   'sequence' ,   'class' :   'uml-sequence-diagram' ,   'format' :   superfences . fence_code_format }  ]   As defined above, the custom UML diagrams are recognized when defining a fenced code block with either the language  flow  or  sequence .  When they are converted, the HTML element containing this content will have the respective classes  uml-flowchart  or  uml-sequence-diagram . The format function we used in this example only escapes the content to be included in HTML. We will rely on JavaScript libraries to render our flowcharts/diagrams in the browser.  The JavaScript libraries used to render UML in this document are  flowchart.js  and  sequence-diagram.js . This extension does not provide these JavaScript libraries; you must provide the necessary JavaScript files for your custom fences yourself. If you wish to follow along with this example to enable UML, see the requirements below.   flowcharts    raphael.js  flowchart.js    sequence diagrams   Minimum requirements for the latest version available via CDN (at the time of writing this).   raphael.js  underscore.js  sequence-diagram.js     All of the above mentioned libraries can be included using CDNs (you can use the version of your choice):  < script   src = \"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/raphael/2.2.7/raphael.min.js\" ></ script >  < script   src = \"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/underscore.js/1.8.3/underscore-min.js\" ></ script >  < script   src = \"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/js-sequence-diagrams/1.0.6/sequence-diagram-min.js\" ></ script >  < script   src = \"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/flowchart/1.6.5/flowchart.min.js\" ></ script >   Simply including the libraries above is not enough as these libraries need to be pointed at the elements they need to convert.  Also, we need to configure the libraries with the settings we would like.  As mentioned earlier, our flowchart elements have the  uml-flowchart  class assigned to them, and the sequence diagram elements have the  uml-sequence-diagram  class assigned to them. Below shows an example script to convert the UML diagrams for both flowcharts and sequence diagrams using the listed libraries above. This script will target the elements with the classes  uml-flowchart  and  uml-sequence-diagram . The script will pass the content to the correct library to render the content.  It will then insert the rendered UML and remove the original source. This is just an example, and you are not required to use the following script. You are free to modify the example script or write your own to suite your specific custom fence.  In the below example we create an  onReady  function to execute the conversion when the HTML is loaded.  We create a  convertUML  function that takes the class name to search for, the converter to use, and a settings object to feed into the converter.  We then call  onReady  and feed it a callback function that will execute  convertUML  for flowcharts and for sequence diagrams. Notice that  convertUML  can handle both the  < pre >< code >  format or the  < div >  format we mentioned earlier.  The actual  convertUML  function reads UML instructions from our element and sticks it in a div that gets appended to our main HTML content (in this case we look for the the  body  tag, but it could be anything).

Normally Python Markdown does not parse content inside HTML tags unless they are marked with the attribute  markdown='1' .  But since this is run as a preprocessor, it is not aware of the HTML blocks.  SuperFences is made to work with the default extensions out of the box.  It will probably not work with other extensions such as Grid Tables, since that extension allows for characters to obscure the blocks like the blockquote syntax does (though this has been designed to work with blockquotes).  Ideally fenced blocks need to be handled by a block parser, but there is much work to be done on Python Markdown's internal block handlers before this is possible.  SuperFences works best when following the guidelines.  If the guidelines are not followed, odd results may be encountered.  For the reasons above, the nested fences feature really is just a workaround.  But for a lot of people, this functionality is more than sufficient.",

The PyMdown Extensions project utilizes the Flake8 linter (with some additional plugins) to ensure code conforms (give or take some of the rules).  When in doubt follow the formatting hints of existing code when adding or modifying files. existing files.  Listed below are the modules used:\n\n\n\n\npycqa/flake8\n\n\npycqa/flake8-docstrings\n\n\npycqa/pep8-naming\n\n\nebeweber/flake8-mutable\n\n\ngforcada/flake8-builtins\n\n\n\n\nFlake8 can be run directly via the command line from the root of the project.\n\n\nflake8\n\n\n\n\nBuilding and Editing Documents\n\ue157\n\n\nDocuments are in Markdown (with with some additional syntax) and converted to HTML via Python Markdown and this extension bundle. If you would like to build and preview the documentation, you must have these packages installed:\n\n\n\n\nPython-Markdown/markdown\n: the Markdown parser.\n\n\nmkdocs/mkdocs\n: the document site generator.\n\n\nsquidfunk/mkdocs-material\n: a material theme for MkDocs.\n\n\nfacelessuser/pymdown-extensions\n: this Python Markdown extension bundle.\n\n\n\n\nIn order to build and preview the documents, just run the command below from the root of the project and you should be able to view the documents at \nlocalhost:8000\n in your browser. After that, you should be able to update the documents and have your browser preview update live.\n\n\nmkdocs serve\n\n\n\n\nEditing Document Theme\n\ue157\n\n\nIt isn't expected that people will need to mess with the theme, but if it is needed, a little additional work is required. The documents use the \nMaterial\n theme for \nMkDocs\n with some additional local tweaks and additions.  JavaScript additions are provided in \ndocs/src/js\n and are in es2015 syntax and are converted to es5. Stylesheets are located at \ndocs/src/scss\n and are written in SCSS, and are converted to CSS.  All conversions are done in a \nNode.js\n environment.  In order to get up and running, download and install \nYarn\n. Also, install \nNode.js\n version 6+. From the root of the project, in a terminal, enter the command below.  This command will install all the needed \nNode.js\n modules.\n\n\nyarn install\n\n\n\n\nAfter that you can begin making changes. When ready, you can run the following commands to get a live preview while you make edits, lint your changes, or build the final output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYarn\u00a0Commands\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nyarn serve\n\n\nCreate a live preview at \nlocalhost:8000\n that will pick up your changes as you make them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nyarn build\n\n\nBuild the final output which will package, minimize, and revision the scripts and stylesheets.  It will also update the \nmkdocs.yml\n file to point to the new revisioned files.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nyarn lint\n\n\nRun just lint on the files.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nyarn clean_all\n\n\nThis will clean out the generated CSS and JavaScript files. It will also cleanup the generated MkDocs' site.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you need to make changes to the \nmkdocs.yml\n file, do not update the one in project root directly, but update the one in \ndocs/src\n. The build environment copies the one in \ndocs/src\n to the project root and injects the revisioned script name(s) and stylesheet name(s).\n\n\nWhen serving via \nyarn\n, if you want to make sure that the local version of \npymdown-extensions\n is used, you need to configure \nyarn serve\n to call with Python instead of calling the MkDocs binary: \nyarn serve --mkdocs=\"python3 -m mkdocs\"\n.  This is because if you are calling Python, it will look in the current working directory first for a given module when importing, but if you call the MkDocs binary, it will instead import the installed \npymdown-extensions\n. Configuring the \n--mkdocs\n option is also useful if \nmkdocs\n is not in your path, or you want to call with a specific version of Python.\n\n\nSpell Checking Documents\n\ue157\n\n\nDuring validation we build the docs and run a spell checker on them.  The spell checker script uses \nAspell\n.  Currently this project uses the latest Aspell.  As the latest Aspell is not available on Windows, it is not expected that everyone will install and run Aspell locally.  In order to perform the spell check, it is expected you are setup to build the documents, and that you have Aspell installed in the your system path. To initiate the spell check run the following command from the root of the project:\n\n\npython tests/spelling.py\n\n\n\n\nIt should print out the files with the misspelled words if any are found.  If you find it prints words that are not misspelled, you can add them in \n.dictionary\n in the root of the project.\n\n\nValidation Tests\n\ue157\n\n\nIn order to preserve good code health, a test suite has been put together with pytest (\npytest-dev/pytest\n). There are currently two kinds of tests: syntax and targeted.  To run these tests, you can use the following command:\n\n\npython run_tests.py\n\n\n\n\nSyntax\n\ue157\n\n\nSyntax tests are essentially text files containing Markdown. They are found under \ntests/extensions\n.  \ntest_syntax.py\n scans all the files and converts the files to HTML with the extensions and options defined in \ntests/extensions/tests.yml\n.  They are then compared to the current stored HTML output.  If the two differ, the test fails.\n\n\nTo run \nonly\n these tests, from the root of the project run the following command:\n\n\npython run_tests.py --test-target syntax\n\n\n\n\nYou could also run them directly with:\n\n\npy.test tests/test_syntax.py\n\n\n\n\nTo run a specific syntax test:\n\n\npython run_tests.py --test-target syntax --file tests/extensions/arithmatex.txt\n\n\n\n\nTo accept the differences in tests due to a change(s) you made, you can run the following command:\n\n\npython run_tests.py --update\n\n\n\n\nTo update and accept the differences in a single test:\n\n\npython run_tests.py --update --file tests/extensions/arithmatex.txt\n\n\n\n\nTargeted\n\ue157\n\n\nTargeted tests are unit tests that target specific areas in the code and exercises them to ensure proper functionality.  These tests are found in \ntest_targeted.py\n.\n\n\nYou can run \nonly\n these tests from the root of the project with:\n\n\npython run_tests.py --test-target targeted\n\n\n\n\nYou could also run them directly with:\n\n\npy.test tests/test_targeted.py\n\n\n\n\nRunning Validation With Tox\n\ue157\n\n\nTox (\ntox-dev/tox\n) is a great way to run the validation tests, spelling checks, and linting in virtual environments so as not to mess with your current working environment. Tox will use the specified Python version for the given environment and create a virtual environment and install all the needed requirements (minus Aspell).  You could also setup your own virtual environments with the Virtualenv module without Tox, and manually do the same.\n\n\nFirst, you need to have Tox installed:\n\n\npip install tox\n\n\n\n\nBy running Tox, it will walk through all the environments and create them (assuming you have all the python versions on your machine) and run the related tests.  See \ntox.ini\n to learn more.\n\n\ntox\n\n\n\n\nIf you don't have all the Python versions needed to test all the environments, those entries will fail.  You can ignore those.  Spelling will also fail if you don't have the correct version of Aspell.\n\n\nTo target a specific environment to test, you use the \n-e\n option to select the environment of interest.  To select lint:\n\n\ntox -elint\n\n\n\n\nTo select PY27 unit tests (or other versions \u2013 change accordingly):\n\n\ntox -epy27-unittests\n\n\n\n\nTo select spelling and document building:\n\n\ntox -edocuments\n\n\n\n\nCode Coverage\n\ue157\n\n\nWhen running the validation tests through Tox, it is setup to track code coverage via the Coverage (\nned/coveragepy\n) module.  Coverage is run on each \npyxx-unittests\n environment.  If you've made changes to the code, you can clear the old coverage data:\n\n\ncoverage erase\n\n\n\n\nThen run each unit test environment to and coverage will be calculated. All the data from each run is merged together.  HTML is output for each file in \n.tox/pyXX-unittests/tmp\n.  You can use these to see areas that are not covered/exercised yet with testing.\n\n\nYou can checkout \ntox.ini\n to see how this is accomplished.\n\n\nGenerating Emoji Indexes\n\ue157\n\n\nThe Emoji extension has emoji indexes generated from the source of Gemoji, EmojiOne, and Twemoji.  Below is the process for auto-generating these indexes.  In the case of Twemoji, it will also reference EmojiOne's short name index, so you may need to do both EmojiOne and Twemoji if the support is not satisfactory.\n\n\n\n\nEnsure you have Requests (\nrequests/requests\n) installed: \npip install requests\n.\n\n\nFork the repository and checkout to your machine.\n\n\nNavigate to the root of the project.\n\n\nCall the generator script: \npython tools/gen_emoji.py --gemoji\n, \npython tools/gen_emoji.py --emojione\n, or \npython tools/gen_emoji.py --twemoji\n. If you already have the latest tag locally, you can specify \n--no-download\n.  It will prompt you to select a tag to download and/or use.  Please pull the latest \nofficial\n tag.  Please don't pull experimental tags.  This should update the indexes.\n\n\nThen you want to update the tests.\n\n\nForce the tests to update via \npython run_tests.py --update\n.  Make sure only the emoji tests get updated.\n\n\n\n\nNothing is fool proof.  If they make a breaking change to the files that the script parses, or the location of the files change, the auto-update tool may need to be updated itself (hopefully this would be a rare occurrence).  If such a change does occur, and you are feeling brave, a pull request would be appreciated, but in time, they will be resolved regardless.",

It will also cleanup the generated MkDocs' site.     If you need to make changes to the  mkdocs.yml  file, do not update the one in project root directly, but update the one in  docs/src . The build environment copies the one in  docs/src  to the project root and injects the revisioned script name(s) and stylesheet name(s).  When serving via  yarn , if you want to make sure that the local version of  pymdown-extensions  is used, you need to configure  yarn serve  to call with Python instead of calling the MkDocs binary:  yarn serve --mkdocs=\"python3 -m mkdocs\" .  This is because if you are calling Python, it will look in the current working directory first for a given module when importing, but if you call the MkDocs binary, it will instead import the installed  pymdown-extensions . Configuring the  --mkdocs  option is also useful if  mkdocs  is not in your path, or you want to call with a specific version of Python.",
